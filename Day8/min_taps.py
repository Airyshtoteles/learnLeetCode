Day 8 â€” Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden (#1326)

Greedy (Jump Game II style):
- Build max reach starting from each position using ranges
- Sweep from left to right, expanding current coverage; when reaching the end
  of current coverage, open a new tap (increment) and extend to farthest reach

Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
