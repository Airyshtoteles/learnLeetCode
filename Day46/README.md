# Day 46: Advanced Algorithmic Challenges

This day focuses on complex pathfinding, simulation, and optimization problems involving state compression, time-dependent weights, and multi-world traversal.

## Problems

1.  **Time-Reversal Dungeon Pathfinding** (Part 1)
    *   **Topic:** Graph + DP + State Compression
    *   **Description:** Navigate a grid with "Time Traps" that reset your accumulated energy cost to zero but keep your position. Find the minimum energy to reach the end.

2.  **Summoning Stones Tower Defense** (Part 2)
    *   **Topic:** Simulation + Priority DP + Greedy
    *   **Description:** Optimize placement of K towers to kill maximum enemies on a linear path.

3.  **Shifting Realms Puzzle** (Part 3)
    *   **Topic:** BFS Multi-World + Bitmask
    *   **Description:** Traverse between 3 parallel grids (Realms A, B, C) with different layouts to reach the goal.

4.  **Arcane Cooldown Optimizer** (Part 4)
    *   **Topic:** DP + Interval Scheduling
    *   **Description:** Maximize damage output given a set of skills with cast times and cooldowns over a duration T.

5.  **Phantom Knight Synchronization** (Part 5)
    *   **Topic:** 3D BFS + Constraints
    *   **Description:** Move two knights simultaneously to a target while maintaining a max distance and hitting synchronization runes.

6.  **The Voidstorm Spiral** (Part 6)
    *   **Topic:** Simulation + Binary Search
    *   **Description:** Survive in a shrinking spiral arena for as long as possible.
