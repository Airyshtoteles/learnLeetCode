# Day 48: Advanced State-Space & Optimization

This day focuses on complex state management, dynamic programming with bitmasks, and graph theory with global state changes.

## Problems

1.  **Quantum Mirror Labyrinth** (Part 1)
    *   **Topic:** BFS on Composite State (Real/Mirror)
    *   **Description:** Navigate a grid with two inverted layers. Use "Mirror Gates" to switch worlds, handling dynamic passability.

2.  **Time-Loop Survivors Arena** (Part 2)
    *   **Topic:** DP with Cooldowns & Bitmask
    *   **Description:** Maximize kills in a time-limited arena using 3 skills with different cooldowns and AoE properties.

3.  **Dungeon Switchboard Optimization** (Part 3)
    *   **Topic:** BFS with Global State (Color Phase)
    *   **Description:** Traverse a graph where edges trigger global color shifts, restricting entry to rooms based on their current color phase.

4.  **Arcane Forge Production Line** (Part 4)
    *   **Topic:** Math / Independent Scheduling
    *   **Description:** Maximize production value from parallel machines with specific craft times and cooldowns within a total time limit.

5.  **Spirit-Link Guardians** (Part 5)
    *   **Topic:** Bitmask DP / Ordering
    *   **Description:** Select and order the activation of guardians to maximize total power, leveraging chain buffs that apply to inactive neighbors.
