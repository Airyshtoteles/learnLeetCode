# Day 51: Advanced Algorithms Challenge

Today's challenge involves 5 "Hard" algorithmic problems covering various domains:

1. **Crystal Labyrinth Teleportation** (Graph/BFS/Bitmask)
   - Navigate a grid with teleporters and crystals.
   - Collect all crystals and reach the exit in minimum steps.

2. **Tournament of Shadows** (Scheduling/Beam Search)
   - Maximize damage output given skills with cooldowns and cast times.
   - Solved using Beam Search to handle the complex state space.

3. **Quantum Nim** (Game Theory/Memoization)
   - A variant of Nim with entangled piles.
   - Solved using Minimax with Memoization (Sprague-Grundy logic).

4. **Virus Containment** (Graph/Max-Flow Min-Cut)
   - Isolate critical servers from infected ones by removing minimum connections.
   - Solved using Edmonds-Karp Max Flow algorithm.

5. **Relic Arena** (DP/Interval Scheduling)
   - Maximize value of collected relics with time intervals and cooldowns.
   - Solved using Dynamic Programming with Binary Search.
