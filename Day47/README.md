# Day 47: Advanced Simulation & Graph Challenges

This day focuses on complex graph traversals, optimization, and state-space search.

## Problems

1.  **Echo of the Mirror Boss** (Part 1)
    *   **Topic:** BFS on Composite State
    *   **Description:** Navigate a grid where a "Boss" mirrors your movements inversely. Both entities must land on valid cells for a move to be valid.

2.  **Necromancer’s Minion Network** (Part 2)
    *   **Topic:** Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm)
    *   **Description:** Connect all minion outposts with minimum mana cost, handling "corrupted" connections that cost double.

3.  **Celestial Platform Shifter** (Part 3)
    *   **Topic:** Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)
    *   **Description:** Navigate a grid of platforms with varying heights. Use "Celestial Shift" magic to bridge gaps larger than your jump limit.

4.  **Chrono Arena Turn Scheduler** (Part 4)
    *   **Topic:** Dynamic Programming + Binary Search
    *   **Description:** Minimize damage taken from a sequence of attacks by optimally activating a "Chrono Shield" with duration and cooldown constraints.

5.  **Forbidden Hex Arena** (Part 5)
    *   **Topic:** Hexagonal Grid BFS
    *   **Description:** Find the shortest path on a 3D-coordinate Hex Grid using walking, blinking (line-of-sight dash), and rune teleportation.
