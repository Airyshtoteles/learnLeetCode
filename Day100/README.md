# Day 100: The Grand Finale - Algorithmic Mastery

Congratulations on reaching Day 100! This folder contains 7 complex problems covering distinct high-level algorithmic concepts, serving as a comprehensive test of competitive programming skills.

## Part 1: Temporal Island Connectivity
- **Concepts**: Disjoint Set Union (DSU), Fenwick Tree (BIT), Offline Processing.
- **Problem**: Queries about graph connectivity where edges have birth times.
- **Complexity**: O(Q log N + M log M).

## Part 2: K-Compressed Palindromic Subsequence
- **Concepts**: Dynamic Programming, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), 3D State.
- **Problem**: Longest palindromic subsequence on RLE compressed string with K deletions allowed.
- **Complexity**: O(N^2 * K).

## Part 3: Infinite Binary Tree Lock
- **Concepts**: Tree Properties, Hash Maps, Ancestor/Descendant Tracking.
- **Problem**: Locking nodes in an infinite binary tree (Node `i` has children `2i`, `2i+1`) with concurrency constraints.
- **Complexity**: O(log Index) per operation.

## Part 4: Graph With Time-Decaying Edges
- **Concepts**: Shortest Path (Dijkstra), Time-Dependent Weights.
- **Problem**: Shortest path where edge weights change based on arrival time or edges expire.
- **Complexity**: O(E log V) per query (Modified Dijkstra).

## Part 5: Maximum XOR Rectangle
- **Concepts**: 2D Prefix XOR, Sliding Window, Trie/Bit Manipulation.
- **Problem**: Find the sub-rectangle with maximum XOR sum, constrained by max width/height.
- **Complexity**: O(N^2 * M * log MaxVal).

## Part 6: Self-Healing String (Range Palindrome Query)
- **Concepts**: Segment Tree, Bitmasks, Popcount.
- **Problem**: Update characters and query if a substring can be rearranged into a palindrome.
- **Complexity**: O(log N) per operation.

## Part 7: Dynamic Median
- **Concepts**: Two Heaps (Min/Max), Lazy Deletion.
- **Problem**: Maintain a stream of numbers with `add`, `remove`, and `median` support.
- **Complexity**: O(log N) per operation.
